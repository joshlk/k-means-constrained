# Build and test

Notes:
* Numpy build version is in `pyproject.toml` while the runtime version is in `requirements.txt`
* Check which Python versions a new version of Numpy is compatible with. Also check ortools as this is slower to update.
* Change the Python versions in the GitHub action. Also change the badge in the README and the comment in the installation section.
* You might need to increase the ciwheelbuild version in the GitHub action to be able to use new Python versions
* Check ciwheelbuild example if you need to change runner image versions (e.g. MacOS, Windows or Ubuntu).
    Change as little as possible so not to run into other errors:

* Add changes to the change log

Steps:

1. Build and test locally:

To build Cython extensions in source:
```shell script
make compile
```

To test:
```shell script
pytest
```

2. Push changes to GitHub to build it for all platforms (if you get errors check notes above)

3. Add changes to change log and bump version  (major, minor or patch). Push changes (so dist have new version):

```shell script
bump2version patch
```

4. Download distributions (artifacts)

```shell script
make download-dists ID=$BUILD_ID
```

5. Upload to test PyPi (you can get PyPI API token in password manager)

```shell script
make check-dist
make test-pypi
```

6. Activate virtual env (might need to `make venv-create`)

```shell script
source k-means-env/bin/activate
```

7. Test install (in virtual env. *****Remember to cd out of k-means-constrained folder*****):

```shell script
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple k-means-constrained
```

8. Then push to real PyPI:

```shell script
make pypi-upload
```
